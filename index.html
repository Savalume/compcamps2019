    <li  class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Megan and I welcome you to my website! Here you will see information about a game I would like to make in the future, but, right now it's still a work in progress ;/
    Other then that, i will be explaining my process of this website and what i learnt this year at compcamps!! </li>
    <li class="paragraph4"> For starters, This is my first year at Comp Camps. In the end i had a pretty good time with coding my website, learning how to code animation into a unity game, and meeting amazing new people with the same interst as me!
    Starting about what i learnt. well, let's just say i had a lot of help from everyone to make this website the greatest it could be, so, thank you very much to instutors, campers and of course Google! :)</li>
    <li class="paragraph5"> For coding i leant the basics of coding and a little bit of javascript. mostly used on my website is HTML, and css. Everyone who came to compcamp once knows that we primarily use Atom, a simple coding site which used in order to code up our own website which your seeing right now ;) Something I would like to do is take my knowledgeave to create a cool first person mystery game.( information on my project page) </li>
<li class="paragraph6">Below i will show you some of the coding i used for my website. The first one is showing html, the seconde the Javascript, then the css. If you hover over the photo's it will give you more information on the type of coding used. </li>

        <td><div class="container">
          <img src="img/html.png" alt="HTML Work" class="image">
          <div class="overlay">
            <div class="text">Html is basic use for coding. it was used for everything except for decoration or moving images/objects added. I used html for adding text to my website, adding images and the background.</div>
          </div>

          <img class="image" src="img/js.PNG" alt="Forest"/>
          <div class="overlay">
            <div class="text">Javascript is a little bit more complex but, in my opinion i think it is used more for complex coding, while html is used more for basic coding. with html you are limited to your coding, but, with javascript it let's you do way more.</div>

        <div class="overlay">
          <div class="text1">css is used for decorating your website. you add a image using html then you use the css to move objects/images, make any object smaller or biggger, and you can even change font size and font it self! basically customize your website however you want.</div>
