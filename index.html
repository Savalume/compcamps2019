    <li  class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Megan and I welcome you to my website! Here you will see information about a game I would like to make in the future, but, right now it's still a work in progress ;/
    Other then that, i will be explaining my process of this website and what i learnt this year at compcamps!! </li>
    <li class="paragraph4"> For starters, This is my first year at Comp Camps. In the end i had a pretty good time with coding my website, learning how to code animation into a unity game, and meeting amazing new people with the same interst as me!
    Starting about what i learnt. well, let's just say i had a lot of help from everyone to make this website the greatest it could be, so, thank you very much to instutors, campers and of course Google! :)</li>
    <li class="paragraph5"> For coding i leant the basics of coding and a little bit of javascript. mostly used on my website is HTML, and css. Everyone who came to compcamp once knows that we primarily use Atom, a simple coding site which used in order to code up our own website which your seeing right now ;) Something I would like to do is take my knowledgeave to create a cool first person mystery game.( information on my project page) </li>
<li class="paragraph6">Below i will show you some of the coding i used for my website. The first one is showing html, the seconde the Javascript, then the css. If you hover over the photo's it will give you more information on the type of coding used. </li>
